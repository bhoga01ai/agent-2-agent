# STEP 1 - Import libraries
from google.adk.a2a.utils.agent_to_a2a import to_a2a
from google.adk import Agent
from google.adk.tools import FunctionTool

def get_weather(city: str) -> str:

# STEP 2 - Create the agent 
root_agent = Agent(

    model="gemini-2.0-flash",
    description=(
        "Agent to answer questions about weather."

# STEP 3 - Make your agent A2A-compatible
# The to_a2a() function will even auto-generate an agent card in-memory behind-the-scenes by extracting skills, capabilities, and metadata from the ADK agent
# so that the well-known agent card is made available when the agent endpoint is served using uvicorn.
# The to_a2a() function will return a FastAPI app instance, which you can then serve using uvicorn.
a2a_app = to_a2a(root_agent, port=8002)

# STEP 4 - Serve the agent using uvicorn
if __name__ == "__main__":
    import uvicorn
    uvicorn.run(a2a_app, host="0.0.0.0", port=8002)

# agent card url : http://localhost:8001/.well-known/agent.json
# The agent card is a JSON file that contains metadata about the agent, such as its name, description, and supported capabilities.
# The agent card is used by the A2A platform to discover and interact with the agent.
